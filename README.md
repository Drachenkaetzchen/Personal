# Open Source Contributions

I've been developing open source software for many years, contributing a lot of code to 3rd party projects and creating popular projects like [PresetMagician](https://presetmagician.com) and [PartKeepr](https://partkeepr.org).

Many projects were created out of personal needs, and I've spent countless hours of my free time to make it usable for others. In fact, I estimate that I have spent more than 10,000 hours on open source development in the past 10 years (approx 3 hours per day). I also provided first-hand support for PartKeepr free of charge, be it via the GitHub issue tracker, mailing list or chat.

# Personal Situation

Open source per se doesn't produce any income. Contributing to the open community is not only fun, but can also be stressful. Part of that stress can be to provide good support to end users and fulfilling their wishes. I'm having a very hard time to say "no". Since I do open source development in my spare time, this adds up to the regular daily schedule. Given an 8 hour work day, you can imagine that 3 hours per day of "extra" effort for open source is a lot. That's why I ask for sponsorships via the [GitHub sponsors program](https://github.com/sponsors/Drachenkaetzchen), [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/drachenkatze) or single donations via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/drachenkatze). That helps me to cover my monthly bills and allows me to work on open source more frequently with less stress.
