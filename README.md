# Open Source Contributions

I've been developing open source software for many years, contributing a lot of code to 3rd party projects and creating popular projects like [PresetMagician](https://presetmagician.com) and [PartKeepr](https://partkeepr.org).

Many projects were created out of a personal need, and I've spent countless hours of my free time to make it usable for others. In fact, I estimate that I have spent more than 10,000 hours on open source development in the past 10 years (approx 3 hours per day). I also provided first-hand support for PartKeepr free of charge, be it via the GitHub issue tracker, mailing list or chat.
